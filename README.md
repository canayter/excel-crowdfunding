· What are some limitations of this dataset?

o 1000 sample projects from Kickstarter may not provide a complete representation of trends of all projects from all crowdfunding platforms available. Sample size can be increased to gain more comprehensive insight on crowdfunding platforms.

o Detailed variables such as budgets for projects, feedback ratings from backers, compensation if any, etc. could refine the dataset even further.

· What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

o # of backers by outcome, compared to # of backers by categories:

§ What categories and/or subcategories appeal to backers the most?

§ How many backers (on average) are needed to achieve success?
